  # Hiya !! welcome welcome ,, this is for ponytown!
  
   (sadly no inages since mobile user!!, still learning LOL! AND YES MY PFP IS MY ART! ^_^)
   
   Animatic / Ani ,, Any pronouns!! , cud+hide/comf is 100% okay with us! Free 2 int!! we dont bite!
   
   Yes.. We roleplay!! sometimes (if we are in a really good mood or bored) ,, we tend to be rather silly and act in character (and out of character ofc!)
       We are an traumagenic DID system ,, 
      we love making new friends (and hanging out w our friends!) were really friendly and silly once you get to know us! we accept you in open arms!!
      
If you are uncomfortable with whatever we do PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE lets us know/srs ,, we have troubles with people not telling us that and we feel immediatley bad, apologizing and going silent. So please lets us know as soon as possible so we can stop ,, we dont like making anyone uncomfortable.

we heavily have ptsd from past trauma and recent trauma events that happened to us. so bare with us if we start having panic attacks or immediatley go quiet and hide somewhere, we need our alone time to calm down , but we do appreciate it when someone checks up on us..

I LOVE TEAM PAPAYA IN ANIMATIC BATTLE AWESOME SAUCE OK? (die hard ab cast fan. die hard team papaya fan.)

Artist !! We love drawing alot !

Ask us who's fronting so you may learn! Please dont mistaken us as just roleplayers. or compare us to our sources. not all are source related! 

WE ARE AN ADULT. 20. ANYONE BELOW 15 DO NOT INTERACT. I SAY 15 BECAUSE SOME OF YALL KIDS/MINORS ARE WEIRD ASF/VLH
