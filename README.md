  # Hiya !! welcome welcome ,, this is for ponytown!
   (sadly no inages since ,, mobile user!!) 
   Four / Jay ,, he/she , they/them (prefer prns) , cud+hide/comf is 100% okay with us! Free 2 int!! we dont bite, unless you're being annoingly rude or attacking for no reason then we will bite back. We may not respond fast if were busy , drawing or asleep !! we will be slow at responding!

   Yes.. We roleplay!! sometimes (if we are in a really good mood or bored) ,, we tend to be rather silly and act in character (and out of character ofc!)
        We are an traumagenic DID system ,, 
      we love making new friends (and hanging out w our friends!) were really friendly and silly once you get to know us! we accept you in open arms!!
If you are uncomfortable with whatever we do PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE lets us know/srs ,, we have troubles with people not telling us that and we feel immediatley bad, apologizing and going silent. So please lets us know as soon as possible so we can stop ,, we dont like making anyone uncomfortable.
we heavily have ptsd from past trauma and recent trauma events that happened to us. so bare with us if we start having panic attacks or immediatley go quiet and hide somewhere, we need our alone time to calm down , but we do appreciate it when someone checks up on us..
Fandoms we're in - OSC!! (Mainly) , forsaken , dandys world (its 50/50) , CRK/CROB (not much) , etc ,, to many to say
Artist !! We love drawing alot ! You may get a chance to see our art maybe once in a while if we ever show it </3
Where are we on the map? Around the osc area! roamning around, or on island map , if were on island map its to avoid people from being overstimulated.
Ask us who's fronting so you may learn! Please dont mistaken us as just roleplayers. or compare us to our sources, some of us hate that. had experiences with fake systems before and we hated it.
our sexualities bodily is , gender-fluid, non-binary, aroace, lesbian, and aromantic. ! Bodily we are 19.
We are like a parental figure to anyone we know really well, that we become a mom/dad to them!       #1 Sprout hater. will NOT be explaining why. persobal reasons for us and may trigger ptsd for some of us.                   
oh how can we forget? Animatic battle is a comf show for us, we may talk about it often BUT we will talk about other shows too !!            
Last thing, we have heavy trust issues. if you wonder why we aren't saying things fully or avoid certain topics its because we dont trust you fully yet. its not your fault, its experiences we gad that lead to trust issues being a huge difficulty for us to trust people again. please dont force us either.
